                            <p>Xenoblade Chronicles 2 features a character named Lora. During the Aegis War, she was a Tornan Driver with the Blades of Jin and Haze. As seen by their nearly identical looks and personality, she and Haze had an extremely tight friendship. In Torna ~ The Golden Country, she is the primary playable character and protagonist alongside Jin. She is a mercenary who is looking for her mother Rynea and Jin's best friend.
