                            <p>In Xenoblade Chronicles 2, Mythra is one of the female main characters. She is the Aegis, a Legendary Blade that can give her Driver Rex and his friends immense strength.</p>

                                <p>They can readily trade places because Pyra is another personality that Mythra developed. When Chapter 5 begins, Rex can freely employ this ability both in and out of combat. Light-element attacks are the main focus of Mythra's abilities. Among her other abilities are the ability to move at almost the speed of light and the ability to see into the future. However, Mythra experiences the same restrictions on her ability to heal and her immortality once Pyra shares her life essence with Rex.
