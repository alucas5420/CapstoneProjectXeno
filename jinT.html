                            <p>In Xenoblade Chronicles 2, Jin is an antagonist. Seconded by Malos, he is the leader of the covert group Torna, which seeks to track down and apprehend Pyra.</p>

                                <p>Jin's abilities center on using ice and having lightning-fast movement; she was formerly referred to be the Paragon of Torna. His abilities have significantly increased since he became a Flesh Eater, and he can now control elementary particles, though occasionally he experiences excruciating pain.</p>
