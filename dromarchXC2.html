                            <p>In Xenoblade Chronicles 2, Dromarch is a Blade. When he is attached to his Driver, Nia, he can strike and heal allies. In combat, Dromarch uses the element of water, wears a pair of rings, and heals. He assumes the form of a white tiger. As though he were a butler, he addresses Nia as "My Lady". Nia rides atop Dromarch's back when she is the main character and he is her on-field Blade.</p>
