                            <p>The protagonist and primary playable character in Xenoblade Chronicles is Shulk. One of the primary forces opposing the Mechon is his ability to wield the Monado, utilizing both the special powers of the blade and future visions. He is frequently referred to as the "Heir to the Monado" by certain people.
