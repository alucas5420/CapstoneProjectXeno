                            <p>In Xenoblade Chronicles 2, Aegaeon is a Special Legendary Blade. He has the ability to give his Driver, Emperor Niall, immense strength. After concludingEmperor Niall is unqualified to be a Driver, he eventually gives Mòrag the Core Crystal. In combat, Aegaeon assumes the role of a Tank, uses the water element, and brandishes a Chroma Katana.</p>

                                <p>Aegaeon is a Blade in Torna ~ The Golden Country that can give his Driver Hugo and his allies a great deal of power.
